"contentText": "QUICK INSIGHTS CONTRIBUTION SAMPLE\n\nGoal: Provide 1–3 concise lessons or surprises from an AI initiative.\n\nStructure:\n1. Context (1 sentence)\n2. Observation / Quote (1–2 sentences)\n3. Lesson (1 sentence)\n4. Optional: Metric or tangible signal\n\nExample:\nContext: We implemented a document summarization tool for client onboarding.\nObservation: Adoption spiked early, then plateaued at 42% because we hadn't embedded usage into daily checklists.\nLesson: If an AI tool's value moment is not anchored to an existing workflow trigger, adoption decays fast.\n\nInstructions:\n- Provide 2–4 insights max.\n- Keep each total block under 120 words.\n- Email to: contribute@example.com"

Only 38% of machine lines had consistent telemetry. Our first model underperformed simply because logging gaps produced blind spots...</p><p><strong>Key Pivot:</strong> We paused modeling for 5 weeks and standardized data capture. Model accuracy jumped from 61% to 83%—the real ‘AI’ breakthrough was a data operations decision.</p><p><strong>Outcome:</strong> 11.7% reduction in unplanned downtime in the first quarter post-launch.</p>",
