                        <p>While 87% of executives call AI a strategic priority, 73% of AI initiatives fail to scale beyond pilot stage—trapped in "pilot purgatory" by unclear ROI, fragmented governance, and compliance fears.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Executive's AI Roadmap</strong> provides the first comprehensive playbook to transform AI from scattered experiments into a measurable, board-ready portfolio that drives competitive advantage while maintaining regulatory compliance.</p>
                        <p>This isn't just another business book—it's a complete executive toolkit featuring 100+ downloadable templates, governance frameworks, and implementation guides created by leaders who have successfully scaled AI initiatives.</p>
